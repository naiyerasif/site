I'm a software engineer, designing solutions across backend, frontend, and infrastructure at an aerospace organization. Before that, I worked at [Wipro](https://www.wipro.com/), on [Wipro Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmes_(computer)) and [Suncorp](https://www.suncorpbank.com.au/) projects.

I'm a pragmatist who works best in short bursts of [flow states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). I'm fluent in English, Urdu, and Hindi. Outside tech bubble, I enjoy reading Urdu poetry, manga, and science fiction, and exploring other languages and cultures. I'm also partial to alcohol-free fragrances and a withering sense of humor. Given steady supply of tea and snacks, I can also be a formidable listener.

## About this site

This is my little corner on the web. It is a stream of notes, essays, and thoughts growing slowly over time &mdash; a personal feed of updates whenever I learn something new. All posts, with their flaws and imperfections, are my handiwork, and are not generated by some [bullshit machine](https://thebullshitmachines.com/index.html).

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), using web platform, without any UI framework. It is deployed by GitHub Actions on Cloudflare Workers. Typography is set with [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter), paired with [Make Sans](https://herewemake.gumroad.com/l/makesans) for headings and [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) for code. I edit the drafts in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and Sublime Text. For illustrations, diagrams and icons, I use Affinity Designer. I don't collect any [analytics](/privacy/).

This version was launched in July 2023, followed by steady updates over time. A refresh happened in October 2025.
