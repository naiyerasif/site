I work as a software engineer, focused on backend and cloud, with occasional forays into frontend. I relish tackling design and engineering problems, preferably in short bursts, with a healthy dose of pragmatism. When I'm not working, I'm reading.

Welcome to my little corner on the web. Here, you'll mostly find technical essays and short updates on my serendipitous learnings, with the occasional opinion piece sneaking in. These posts are a reference for what I learn, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ <ins>constructive feedback</ins>.

Outside the tech bubble, I like to explore the vocabularies and nuances of languages that fascinate me. I find joy in Urdu poetry, animated movies and TV shows, and sharing tea-fueled conversations. I'm also partial to alcohol-free fragrances and a dry sense of humor.
