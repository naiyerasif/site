I work as a software engineer, focused on backend and cloud, with occasional forays into frontend. I relish tackling design and engineering problems, preferably in short bursts, with a healthy dose of pragmatism. I like to improve bit by bit every day. This often means learning new things, refactoring code, writing documentation, and improving processes.

When I'm not working, I'm reading. I enjoy Urdu poetry, manga, and science fiction. I'm partial to alcohol-free fragrances and a withering sense of humor. Given steady supply of tea and snacks, I can also be a formidable listener.

## About this site

This site is my little corner on the web. It is mostly technical essays and small whimsical updates whenever I learn something new.

A post on this site starts as an outline in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or a kanban board on [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com). I draft the posts in Obsidian, then move them into the site's project directory for further refinement.

This site is built with the web platform &mdash; it is just HTML, CSS, and custom elements. I use [Astro](https://astro.build) to generate it. For typography, I use [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for body copy, [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) for code, and [Make Sans](https://herewemake.gumroad.com/l/makesans) for headings. I don't collect any [analytics](/privacy/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you write all the content yourself?

Yes. English isn't my first language so I use [Prim](https://github.com/Microflash/Prim), [alex](https://github.com/errata-ai/alex), and [proselint](https://github.com/errata-ai/proselint) to ensure a consistent writing style.

### How can I stay updated with new posts?

You can subscribe to this site using [RSS](https://aboutfeeds.com/). I offer two feeds: one for [posts only](/feed.xml), and another that includes both [posts and notes](/all.xml).

### How can I contact you, or report a mistake?

You can contact me on [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)) for discussion, shout outs, and rants: [@naiyer@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@naiyer)

You can report a mistake by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/naiyerasif/site/issues/new) or sending a pull request through the edit link under a post. I appreciate bug reports and corrections on accessibility, browser rendering inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and general usability concerns.

### Why don't you put ads here to make some money?

I didn't create this site to make money. _This thing is not transactional._

### Can you endorse my product?

No.
