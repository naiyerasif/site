A civilization exerts a certain gravity around which a generation of mankind flourishes. It binds people in a framework of civility, bringing them together, aspiring them to coexist and thrive. If a section of society doesn't do well at the expense of other, or is suppressed or worse, oppressed, then there's a rot in the civilization. It has been subverted and a cancer has set in. It spreads slowly at first, tiptoeing around people cocooned in their risk averse fabric of existence. There's a growing discomfort, a nagging feeling of something not right. The rot becomes evident enough sooner or later, and it falls on the society to make the choice: fix the disease or let it fester. Skirting this choice just shreds the veneer of civility and unmasks the putrefaction.
