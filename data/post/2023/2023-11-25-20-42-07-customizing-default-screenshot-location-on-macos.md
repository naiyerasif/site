If you don't want macOS cluttering the Desktop with screenshots (and screen recordings), you can change the default location where macOS saves them. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Command</kbd> <kbd>5</kbd>, hit __Options__, and select __Other Location&hellip;__. Pick a preferred directory in Finder. macOS will save the screenshots at the selected location from now.

This setting may not be present in macOS versions preceding Mojave. You may have to resort to configuring defaults with Terminal on them.
