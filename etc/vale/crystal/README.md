A Vale-compatible prose style for non-native English speakers

## Guiding principles

- Use short sentences (< 30 words).
- Use active voice in simple present tense.
- Avoid Latin to prevent a yet another language in the mix. Use English equivalents. 
- Use an apostrophe only to indicate a possessive. Do not use it for contractions.
