I'm a software engineer on an Aviation product, working on the microservices and enterprise APIs. Before this, I worked as a full-stack engineer at [Wipro Holmes](https://www.wipro.com/holmes/) and as an ETL consultant for [Suncorp](https://www.suncorp.com.au/).

I like solving problems and exploring ideas. I work in small bursts and in balanced iterations. I'm patient at listening and candid while speaking. I read to relax. For more details about my experience, take a look at the [stacktrace](/stacktrace/).

## About this site

I learn things with practice. Originally, I built this site with [Gridsome](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome) to learn [Vue 2](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). In 2022, I reworked it using [Lume](https://lume.land/) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).

Building a personal site made me aware of the web community, inspired me to contribute to the open source, and taught me valuable lessons on accessibility, web performance, typography, design, and more. It also spurred my networking with people from different backgrounds.

## All code is _compromise_

:::deter{label=Disclaimer}
All the examples on this site are __optimized for learning__ and __not for use in production__.
:::

Apply your judgement, discuss with your peers, and use what's best suited for _your_ usecase. If you do spot something that's horribly wrong, give me a shout on Twitter [@Microflash](https://twitter.com/Microflash) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/Microflash/site/discussions/new) on GitHub. If you want to improve something, I've provided the edit links under each post.

Most of the posts here are guides and tutorials that document a concept or process. They serve as a reference for what I learn, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback.

## _The Stack_

It's fashionable to build personal sites and talk about their stack. I got this asked many times so here’s the _stack_ of this site.

- [Lume](https://lume.land/): the Jamstack framework that generates this site
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/): very light JavaScript framework to build interactivity
- [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) & [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype): the markdown and HTML processors
- [Leonardo](https://leonardocolor.io/): an app by Adobe behind the color science of this site
- [Sugar](https://github.com/Microflash/site/blob/main/src/_includes/styles/sugar/): my own classless CSS library for text-heavy websites
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/): the CSS post-processor
- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/): the library that powers the search
- [Starry Night](https://github.com/wooorm/starry-night): the library that powers the syntax highlighting of the code
- [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono): the body and `monospace` fonts
- [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale): a style and grammar linter for prose
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions): the CI/CD tool that builds and deploys this site
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com/): they host this site and serve it over a CDN

:::note
You shouldn't get too hung up on the _stack_ or _tools_. Choose something that’s handy, that lets you do your work, and get started. _Getting started_ is crucial.
