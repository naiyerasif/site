I was playing with [11ty/is-land](https://github.com/11ty/is-land) by [@zachleat](https://www.zachleat.com/) on my site built with [Lume](https://lume.land) and this thought struck me: its so incredible that this thing is framework / library agnostic. Such a webby thing to do. We need to build more of such things.
