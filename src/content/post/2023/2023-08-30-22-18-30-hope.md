> It's easy to feel hopeful on a beautiful day like today. But there will be dark days ahead of us too. There will be days where you feel all alone. And that's when hope is needed most. No matter how buried it gets, or how lost you feel, you must promise me that you will hold on to hope. Keep it alive.

> We have to be greater than what we suffer. My wish for you is to become hope. People need that. And even if we fail, what better way is there to live?
