[Unlighthouse](https://unlighthouse.dev/) by [Harlan Wilton](https://harlanzw.com/) is an invaluable tool to scan your _entire_ site with Lighthouse. It runs as a command line tool and displays results through a beautiful web interface. And it just works with minimal configuration. I've been using it to audit [naiyer.dev](https://naiyer.dev) and couldn't recommend it enough.
