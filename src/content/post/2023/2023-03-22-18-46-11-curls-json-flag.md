<abbr title="Today I learned">TIL</abbr> that [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) supports a `--json` flag to send and accept JSON responses since version 7.82.0, which means that the following requests,

```sh prompt{1,6}
curl --data '{"name": "morpheus"}' \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--request POST https://example.com/api/users

curl -d '{"name": "morpheus"}' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-X POST https://example.com/api/users
```

can be further shortened as follows:

```sh prompt{1}
curl --json '{"name": "morpheus"}' \
-X POST https://example.com/api/users
```
