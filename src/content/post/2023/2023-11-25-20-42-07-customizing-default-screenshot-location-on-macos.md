If you don't want macOS cluttering the Desktop with screenshots (and screen recordings), you can change the default location where macOS saves them. Press <kbd>Shift + Command + 5</kbd>, hit __Options__, and select __Other Location&hellip;__. Pick a preferred directory in Finder. macOS will save the screenshots at the selected location from now.
