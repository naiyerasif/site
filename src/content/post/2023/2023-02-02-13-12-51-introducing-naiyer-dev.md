Barely a yearly has passed since I launched the last [version](/post/2022/07/13/microflash-version-2/) of this site and here I'm with a fresh rewrite. You might be thinking: developers and their never-ending blog rewrites, ðŸ™„! But hear me out on why I did it.

## Ownership of my content

2022 was an eventful year for Twitter, my primary social network. This got people talking about the ownership of their content and [building their own little corner on the web](https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging). 

Many folks took this to heart and implemented this beautifully. Take a look at Adam Argyle's [nerdy.dev](https://nerdy.dev) and Jhey Tompkins' [jhey.dev](https://jhey.dev). In a similar vein, this version moves a lot of my content from Twitter and elsewhere to one place.

With this change, you'd notice a more personal tone on this site. For those who subscribe through RSS, the [original feed](/feed.xml) will continue to syndicate everything except my statuses. If you want to keep track of everything I post here, subscribe to a new [everything feed](/all.xml) using your favorite RSS reader.

> Speaking of RSS, I gave it a bit more prominent treatment in the footer, with a link to [Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org/home/)'s excellent [explainer about all things RSS](https://aboutfeeds.com/).

## New domain

This site was located at [mflash.dev](https://mflash.dev). Microflash was my username on Twitter. I've been de-emphasizing its use lately. The move to a new domain [naiyer.dev](https://naiyer.dev) is a part of that effort.

The old domain will continue to work. The redirection rules will transparently take care of switching the domain and whatnot.[^1]

[^1]: I've not configured the redirections yet but they'll be in effect sometime this month.

## So, what's new?

Here are some quality of life improvements introduced in this version.

### Command bar

The popularity of [Spotlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(Apple)) inspired search boxes has been on the rise lately.[^2] They're pretty handy way to offer search and navigation for your site.

This version replaces the good old search with a Command bar (represented by &#8984; symbol).

I've used [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) to power the fuzzy search here. You can search posts, navigation, and even preferences (such as theme) to surface relevant results for you.

### Bottom navigation bar for small screens

I've switched from the traditional hamburger menu (which sat on top right in the previous version) to a bottom navigation bar on small screens.

You'll have reachable access to home, posts, command bar and a link to jump to the top all the time.

### Progressive enhancements

In the last version, I cut down the amount of JavaScript from ~300 KB to ~70 KB (by switching from Vue.js to Alpine.js). Now, I've removed Alpine.js as well and switched to web components and vanilla JavaScript. This has brought down the amount of scripts from ~70KB to ~31KB. As a result, this site should be less of a burden on your device and network.

And if you're visiting this site with JavaScript turned off, things would still work and you'd have good time reading my posts.

### Other changes

- The table of contents now shows more items. Pretty handy if you need to quickly jump into subsections of an article.
- I swapped [Lume](https://lume.land) with [Astro](https://astro.build) mainly because I was facing a lot of paper cuts with [Deno](https://deno.land). Lume is fantastic and I still use it in many places.
- I've audited each page of this site with Lighthouse and the overall score sits at 96 which I think is acceptable for now. I'll continue to improve the score in future and keep running the scan on newer pages.
- There's a new logo which accompanies this launch. I can wax philosophical about how it looks like the character `n`, bookmark icon or game controller but it really is just a shape that I found unique enough to represent my personal branding.
