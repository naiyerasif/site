I'm happy to get the fourth version of this site out in open. This is an iterative update building on the top of the [third version](/post/2023/02/02/introducing-naiyer-dev/) of this site launched earlier this year.

## Say hello to [naiyerasif.com](https://naiyerasif.com)

I must admit I was taking this update pretty leisurely until Google pulled the rug under my feet. In June, [news surfaced](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36346454) that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, was selling [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) to Squarespace. Most of my domains are on Google Domains and this news spurred me to decide to transfer them to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

Unfortunately, neither Cloudflare nor AWS support `.dev` <abbr title="Top-level Domain">TLD</abbr>, yet. I was sitting on [naiyerasif.com](https://naiyerasif.com) for a while and decided to make it the canonical domain of this site. The existing [naiyer.dev](https://naiyer.dev) and [mflash.dev](https://mflash.dev) domains will eventually start redirecting to this address.

## What's new?

- **More items on each page** It's usually easier to scroll stuff compared to switching to new page to view them. Therefore, [home](/) and [posts](/posts/) pages now display 20 items (up from 10 items) on each page.
- **Accessibility** score is up from 96 to 98 averaged on the Lighthouse scans run on all the pages. With better contrast, reading the content here should be a comfortable experience.
- **Command Bar** component now works well with keyboard, mouse and touch inputs. You can now invoke it with <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> if you have keyboard attached to your machine. Earlier, this was crashing on Safari and Firefox.
