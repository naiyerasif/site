> At times, the expression and presentation of human body is so potent that a man or woman gazing at you from these figures becomes an obsession of your mind. After the first few moments of awe, I started to feel inferior. That I'm not like these good-looking men, the conventions of whose curves and cuts have been tethered. Everyone has to be slim and attractive within these conventions. These figures start insisting that if you're chubby, if you're unshapely, and not as captivating, it is worthless to exist in this world or in front of this shop. The brunt of their impact on someone's mind can be devastating. While staring at the frames of men and women, I'm inclined to ask if they are an advertisement of bodies or commercial for clothes. Models and mannequins overrun you, challenge you to buy them if you've money to afford or a proportioned figure to put them on.
