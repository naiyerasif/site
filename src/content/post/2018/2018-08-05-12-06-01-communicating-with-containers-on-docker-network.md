Say, you've an Angular app that talks to a backend service through a network. Both of them are running in separate containers, which can be on the same or different Docker stack(s). You want only the Angular container to be publicly accessible through a port.

Let's run through some scenarios on how you can achieve this.

:::setup
The examples in this post use

- Java 13
- Node 12
- Micronaut 1.3.2
- Angular 9
- Docker 19
:::

We'd need an Angular app and a backend service to begin with.

## Create a backend service

Let's create a very simple backend that will return a greeting message when a `/hello` endpoint will be called. We'll use [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) to generate this service. [Install](https://micronaut.io/download.html) Micronaut CLI and execute the following command on the terminal.

```sh prompt{1}
mn create-app dev.mflash.guides.greeter.greeter-api --build maven
```

This will generate a basic Micronaut app with Maven support. Import this app in your favorite IDE.

:::note
Micronaut CLI will set the Java version in `pom.xml` with the one available on the PATH environment variable.
:::

Create a class for greeting message.

```java
// greeter-api/src/main/java/dev/mflash/guides/greeter/Greeting.java

public class Greeting {

  private String message;

  // constructors, getters, setters, etc
}
```

Configure an endpoint, say `/hello`, that returns a `Greeting` object.

```java {6-9}
// greeter-api/src/main/java/dev/mflash/guides/greeter/GreetingController.java

@Controller("/hello")
public class GreetingController {

  @Get
  public Greeting greet(@QueryValue(value = "name", defaultValue = "World") String name) {
    return new Greeting(String.format("Hello, %s!", name));
  }
}
```

To let the Angular app call this endpoint, we'll have to enable CORS. To do this, edit `application.yml` file and add the following configuration.

```yaml
# greeter-api/src/main/resources/application.yml

micronaut:
  application:
    name: greeter-api
  server:
    port: 8084
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        web:
          allowedOrigins:
            - http://0.0.0.0:4200
```

This backend will run on an embedded server on the port `8084` and will accept all the requests coming from `http://0.0.0.0:4200`.

Edit the `Dockerfile` in the project root and overwrite it with the following configuration.

```dockerfile
# greeter-api/Dockerfile

FROM maven:3.6.1-jdk-13-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /usr/home/greeter
COPY . .
RUN mvn package

FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk13-openj9:jre-13.0.2_8_openj9-0.18.0-alpine
COPY --from=builder /usr/home/greeter/target/greeter-api-*.jar greeter-api.jar
EXPOSE 8084
CMD ["java", "-jar", "greeter-api.jar"]
```

To build a Docker image, execute the following command on the terminal.

```sh
docker build -t mflash/greeter-api .
```

## Create an Angular app

For the sake of example, let's generate a very minimal Angular app with no routing, specifications or external templates. Execute the following command on the terminal.

```sh
ng new greeter-ui --minimal --routing=false --style=css --skipTests --inlineStyle --inlineTemplate
```

> Refer to [`ng new` reference](https://angular.io/cli/new) for more information on these options.

To call the REST endpoint, we'll need `HttpClientModule`. Add it in the root module of the Angular app.

```typescript {3, 6}
// greeter-ui/src/app/app.module.ts

import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule]
  // declarations, providers, bootstrap, etc
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Create a `GreetingService` by executing the following command.

```sh
ng generate service Greeting
```

Add a method (`getGreeting`) to call the backend service.

```typescript {9-11}
// greeter-ui/src/app/greeting.service.ts

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class GreetingService {
  constructor(private client: HttpClient) {}

  getGreeting() {
    return this.client.get('/hello?name=Microflash');
  }
}
```

:::assert
Don't add any host in front of the endpoint.
:::

Edit `AppComponent` to display the greeting message.

```typescript
// greeter-ui/src/app/app.component.ts

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <main>{{ message }}</main>
  `,
  styles: []
})
export class AppComponent {
  message: string = 'Hello, stranger!';

  constructor(private greetingService: GreetingService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.getMessage();
  }

  getMessage() {
    this.greetingService.getGreeting()
      .subscribe(response => (this.message = response['message']));
  }
}
```

To serve the production build of this app, we can use [Nginx](https://nginx.org/). Create a `default.conf` file in the root of the Angular app and add the following configuration.

```conf
# greeter-ui/default.conf

server {
  listen 4200;

  sendfile on;

  default_type application/octet-stream;

  gzip on;
  gzip_http_version 1.1;
  gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.";
  gzip_min_length 256;
  gzip_vary on;
  gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth;
  gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
  gzip_comp_level 9;
  
  root /usr/share/nginx/html;
  
  location / {
    index index.html index.htm;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
  }

  location /hello {
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range';

    if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
      add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' 1728000;
      add_header 'Content-Type' 'text/plain; charset=utf-8';
      add_header 'Content-Length' 0;
      return 204;
    }

    if ($request_method = "POST|GET") {
      add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
      add_header 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers' 'Content-Length,Content-Range';
    }

    proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8084;
  }
}
```

Don't worry too much about this configuration; it instructs `nginx` to

- listen for any requests at port `4200`
- serve files from a directory `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- serve `index.html` at `/`
- redirect the requests coming at `/hello` to `http://0.0.0.0:8084/hello`

The last point is important where `nginx` will serve as a proxy for the backend service.

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of the Angular project and add the following.

```dockerfile
# greeter-ui/Dockerfile

# Generate a build
FROM node:12-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN yarn
RUN yarn build

# Serve with Nginx
FROM nginx:1.17-alpine
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
COPY default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
COPY --from=builder /app/dist/greeter-ui /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 4200
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

:::assert{title=Tip}
Create a `.dockerignore` file in the root of the Angular project and add `node_modules` and `dist` directories in it to prevent Docker from copying them while creating the image.
:::

Generate the image by running the following command.

```sh
docker build -t mflash/greeter-ui .
```

## Scenario 1: Containers on the same Docker stack

Consider the first scenario where the Angular app and the backend service are running on the same Docker stack. Create a compose file and add the following configuration. 

```yaml
# scenario-1-on-the-same-network/docker-compose.yml

version: '3'

services:
  greeter-ui:
    image: mflash/greeter-ui
    networks:
      - greeternet
    ports:
      - 4200:4200

  greeter-api:
    image: mflash/greeter-api
    networks:
      - greeternet

networks:
  greeternet:
    driver: bridge
```

> Note that only `greeter-ui` is exposed publicly.

Launch this stack by executing `docker-compose up -d` and browse to <http://localhost:4200>. You'll see the following message displayed on the browser window.

![Greeter UI](/images/post/2018/2018-08-05-12-06-01-communicating-with-containers-on-docker-network-01.png)

This is the default greeting message; we're not getting the message from the backend service. A quick look on the Networks tab in Devtools reveals that we're getting a `502 Bad Gateway` for the request at <http://0.0.0.0:8084/hello?name=Microflash>. That's because Docker assigns some random host to a service; in this case, it is not `0.0.0.0`.

To resolve this issue, open `default.conf` file and replace the host `0.0.0.0` in the `proxy_pass` value with the service name you specified in `docker-compose.yml` (in our case, it's `greeter-api`).

```conf {9}
# greeter-ui/default.conf

server {
  # other configurations

  location /hello {
    # other configurations

    proxy_pass http://greeter-api:8084;
  }
}
```

Rebuild the `greeter-ui` image, launch the stack again and browse to <http://localhost:4200>. You'd see the expected greeting message.

## Scenario 2: Containers on different Docker stacks

The service url <http://greeter-api:8084> won't work unless the containers share the same network. For the containers running on different Docker stacks, we can configure them to connect through the same network.

Create a compose file and add the following configuration for the backend service.

```yaml
# scenario-2-on-different-networks/greeter-api/docker-compose.yml

version: '3'

services:
  greeter-api:
    image: mflash/greeter-api
    networks:
      - greeternet

networks:
  greeternet:
    driver: bridge
```

In this file, we're specifying the backend service and the network `greeternet` associated with this stack.

Create another compose file and add the following configuration for the Angular app.

```yaml
# scenario-2-on-different-networks/greeter-ui/docker-compose.yml

version: '3'

services:
  greeter-ui:
    image: mflash/greeter-ui
    networks:
      - uinet
    ports:
      - 4200:4200

networks:
  uinet:
    external:
      name: greeter-api_greeternet
```

In this file, we're declaring the Angular app exposed over the port `4200` and the network `uinet` which is nothing but a reference for `greeternet`. This will ensure that the services on both the stacks can talk to each other over the network `greeternet`.

Launch both the stacks with `docker-compose up -d` and browse to <http://localhost:4200>. You would see the expected message on the browser window.
