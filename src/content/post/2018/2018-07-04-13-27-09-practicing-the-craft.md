> When we write code, there is always someone behind us. Sometimes it's ourselves after a few hours, days, weeks, or months. But it's often a colleague who comes around to make changes to the code, fix a bug, add a feature, extend the software. To make the code easier for that person to maintain is far beyond an act of benevolence. It's part of being a professional. It's part of practicing the craft.
