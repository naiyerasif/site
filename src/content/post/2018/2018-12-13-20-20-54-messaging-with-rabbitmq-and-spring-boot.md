[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is an open-source message broker that implements several messaging protocols, including AMQP and STOMP. It is frequently used to queue messages and interact with queues. A RabbitMQ server acts as an exchange server (or broker). Clients, written in a variety of languages, enable applications to publish and consume the messages in the queue. 

In this post, we'll learn how to create a queue with RabbitMQ and interact with it using Spring Boot.

:::setup
The examples in this post use

- Java 13
- Spring Boot 2.2.5
- RabbitMQ 3 running as a Docker container
:::

Create a Spring Boot application with `spring-boot-starter-amqp` and [jackson-databind](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind) as the dependencies.

## Create a RabbitMQ broker

Let's start by setting up a RabbitMQ broker; you can choose to [install](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) it on your machine or run it as a container. For later, create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project's root and add the following configuration.

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:

  rabbitmq:
    image: "rabbitmq:3-management"
    container_name: "rmq3"
    hostname: "albatross"
    restart: "no"
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: "rabbitmq"
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: "rabbitmq"
    labels:
      NAME: "rabbitmq1"
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
```

Now, execute the following command on CLI.

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will launch a RabbitMQ3 container. To access the management console, point your browser at <http://localhost:15672/> and login with the same username and password as set in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Define a domain

Say, you want to publish a list of books in a message and then consume it. To do so, define a simple Book class as follows.

```java
// src/main/java/dev/mflash/guides/rabbitmq/domain/Book.java

public class Book {

  private final String isbn;
  private final String title;
  private final String author;

  // constructors, getters and setters, etc.
}
```

Let's create a list of books to publish them on a queue.

## Configure Queue, Topic Exchange and Routing Key

A typical RabbitMQ queue has 
- a name to identify it, 
- an optional routing key to selectively process messages, and 
- an exchange to route the messages to a queue based on the value of a routing key. 

A topic exchange works on a wildcard match of a routing pattern. Topic exchange is not the only type of exchange available for use but it'll suffice for this guide. To bind a queue with an exchange and a routing key, we'll have to create a `Binding` which can be injected through a Bean as follows.

```java
// src/main/java/dev/mflash/guides/rabbitmq/configuration/RabbitMQConfiguration.java

public @Configuration class RabbitMQConfiguration {

  public static final String TOPIC_EXCHANGE_NAME = "mflash-exchange";
  public static final String QUEUE_NAME = "mflash-queue";
  private static final String ROUTING_KEY = "books.#";

  public @Bean TopicExchange topicExchange() {
    return new TopicExchange(TOPIC_EXCHANGE_NAME);
  }

  public @Bean Queue queue() {
    return new Queue(QUEUE_NAME);
  }

  public @Bean Binding binding() {
    return BindingBuilder.bind(queue()).to(topicExchange()).with(ROUTING_KEY);
  }
}
```

## Create a Publisher

A publisher or producer sends the messages in a queue. In our case, itâ€™ll send a list of books. We'll use a `RabbitTemplate` object injected through Spring to send this list in the queue.

```java
// src/main/java/dev/mflash/guides/rabbitmq/service/Publisher.java

public @Service class Publisher implements CommandLineRunner {

  private final RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;
  private final Reader reader;

  public Publisher(RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate, Reader reader) {
    this.rabbitTemplate = rabbitTemplate;
    this.reader = reader;
  }

  public @Override void run(String... args) throws Exception {
    rabbitTemplate
        .convertAndSend(RabbitMQConfiguration.TOPIC_EXCHANGE_NAME, "books.new", getBooks());
    reader.getLatch().await(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  }

  private List<Book> getBooks() {
    List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
    books.add(new BookBuilder().isbn("978-1250078308").title("Archenemies").author("Marissa Meyer")
        .build());
    books.add(new BookBuilder().isbn("978-0399555770").title("Skyward").author("Brandon Sanderson")
        .build());
    books.add(new BookBuilder().isbn("978-0374285067").title("Void Star").author("Zachary Mason")
        .build());

    return books;
  }
}
```

Note that all the published messages are serialized as byte arrays by default. To properly serialize the list of `Book`s, we need to define a message converter for `RabbitTemplate` as an instance of `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter`.

```java {21-29}
// src/main/java/dev/mflash/guides/rabbitmq/configuration/RabbitMQConfiguration.java

public @Configuration class RabbitMQConfiguration {

  public static final String TOPIC_EXCHANGE_NAME = "mflash-exchange";
  public static final String QUEUE_NAME = "mflash-queue";
  private static final String ROUTING_KEY = "books.#";

  public @Bean TopicExchange topicExchange() {
    return new TopicExchange(TOPIC_EXCHANGE_NAME);
  }

  public @Bean Queue queue() {
    return new Queue(QUEUE_NAME);
  }

  public @Bean Binding binding() {
    return BindingBuilder.bind(queue()).to(topicExchange()).with(ROUTING_KEY);
  }

  public @Bean RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    final var rabbitTemplate = new RabbitTemplate(connectionFactory);
    rabbitTemplate.setMessageConverter(messageConverter());
    return rabbitTemplate;
  }

  public @Bean MessageConverter messageConverter() {
    return new Jackson2JsonMessageConverter();
  }
}
```

## Create a Consumer

A reader or consumer will read the messages published by the publisher. In our case, we'll simply print the list.

```java
// src/main/java/dev/mflash/guides/rabbitmq/service/Reader.java

public @Service class Reader {

  private CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);

  @RabbitListener(queues = RabbitMQConfiguration.QUEUE_NAME, containerFactory = "listenerContainerFactory")
  public void receiveMessage(final List<Book> books) {
    books.forEach(System.out::println);
    latch.countDown();
  }

  public CountDownLatch getLatch() {
    return latch;
  }
}
```

A `CountDownLatch` is used to wait for several threads to complete (here, it is set to 1).

To convert the incoming message into a list of books, we'll have to provide the `MessageConverter` to a `RabbitListener`. This can be done by injecting the `MessageConverter` through an instance of `SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory` as follows.

```java {21-27}
// src/main/java/dev/mflash/guides/rabbitmq/configuration/RabbitMQConfiguration.java

public @Configuration class RabbitMQConfiguration {

  public static final String TOPIC_EXCHANGE_NAME = "mflash-exchange";
  public static final String QUEUE_NAME = "mflash-queue";
  private static final String ROUTING_KEY = "books.#";

  public @Bean TopicExchange topicExchange() {
    return new TopicExchange(TOPIC_EXCHANGE_NAME);
  }

  public @Bean Queue queue() {
    return new Queue(QUEUE_NAME);
  }

  public @Bean Binding binding() {
    return BindingBuilder.bind(queue()).to(topicExchange()).with(ROUTING_KEY);
  }

  public @Bean SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory listenerContainerFactory(
      ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    final var factory = new SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory();
    factory.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
    factory.setMessageConverter(messageConverter());
    return factory;
  }

  public @Bean RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    final var rabbitTemplate = new RabbitTemplate(connectionFactory);
    rabbitTemplate.setMessageConverter(messageConverter());
    return rabbitTemplate;
  }

  public @Bean MessageConverter messageConverter() {
    return new Jackson2JsonMessageConverter();
  }
}
```

When the application is launched, the publisher will publish the list of books on a queue called `mflash-queue`. After 10 seconds, the consumer will be called to print the message received from the queue.
