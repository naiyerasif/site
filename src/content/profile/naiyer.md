ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a software engineer from India. This site is my personal space to post about software design, technical implementations, books, and other things that grab my interest. 

Most of the posts here are guides and tutorials that document a concept or process. They serve as a reference for what I learn, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ <ins>constructive feedback</ins>.

I like solving problems and exploring ideas. I work in small bursts. I'm a prolific reader of science fiction, fantasy, manga, and poetry. Professionally, I work on application design, microservices, and cloud integrations of an Aerospace product. You can find more about this on my [work](/work) page.
