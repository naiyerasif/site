This is my personal site. Most of the posts here are technical essays, with occasional sprinkles of my opinions. They serve as a reference for what I learn, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ <ins>constructive feedback</ins>.

I love to read, especially sci-fi, manga, and Urdu poetry. I also adore beautiful typography, natural landscapes, and alcohol-free fragrances. I am a tea person.

Professionally, I have worked on the frontend, backend, and more recently, cloud. I enjoy tackling design and engineering problems, and I prefer to do so in short bursts with a healthy amount of pragmatism.
