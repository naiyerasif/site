ðŸ‘‹ <random-greeting></random-greeting><noscript>Hi</noscript>! I'm a software engineer from India.

I like solving problems, and exploring ideas. I work in small bursts. Reading is my addiction. I love science fiction, manga, and poetry. My professional experience exists at the intersection of the backend, frontend, databases, and lately, cloud. With a lot of application design, requirements analysis and documentation sprinkled on top.

This is my personal site. Most of the posts here are technical essays, with occasional manifestations of my tea-infused opinions. They serve as a reference for what I learn, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ <ins>constructive feedback</ins>.
