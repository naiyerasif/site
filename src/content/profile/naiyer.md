</p>

Welcome to my little corner on the web. You'll find mostly technical essays here, with occasional opinion pieces drifting through. They're a reference for what I learn, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ <ins>constructive feedback</ins>.

I'm a prolific reader of science fiction, manga, and Urdu poetry. I also have a soft spot for beautiful typography, serene landscapes, and alcohol-free fragrances. I'm a tea person.

Professionally, I've worked on frontend, backend, and more recently, cloud. I enjoy tackling design and engineering problems, preferably in short bursts with a healthy dose of pragmatism.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I spotted a mistake &mdash; how can I report it?

- [File an issue](https://github.com/naiyerasif/site/issues/new)
- Click the edit link under a post and send me a PR
- Mention me [@naiyer@mastodon.design](https://mastodon.design/@naiyer) <small>([What is Mastodon?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)))</small>

I also welcome bug reports and corrections on accessibility, browser rendering inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and general usability concerns.

### What is this site built with?

It is a mix of HTML, CSS, and web components, all generated by [Astro](https://astro.build/) &mdash; no flashy frontend frameworks here. For typography, I've used [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for body text, [Make Sans](https://herewemake.gumroad.com/l/makesans) for headings, and [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) for code.

### Why don't you put ads here to make money?

I didn't build this site to make money. It is not designed to drive engagement, or go viral. _This thing is not transactional._

If you're concerned about my finances, you can recommend me for a software engineering position at your company. I am *fleetingly* available on [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/naiyerasif) for leads.

### Can you endorse my product?

No.
