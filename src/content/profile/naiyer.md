ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a software engineer from India. This site is my personal space where I write about software engineering, design, books, and anything that grabs my interest. 

Most of the posts here are guides and tutorials that document a concept or process. They serve as a reference for what I learn, and a source of ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback.

I like solving problems and exploring possibilites. I work in small bursts. I'm a prolific reader of science fiction, fantasy, manga and poetry. Professionally, I work on application design, microservices, and cloud integrations of an Aerospace product. You can find more about this on my [work](/work) page.
