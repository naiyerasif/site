Besides writing code, I compose poetry, draw vector illustrations and automate boring repetitive stuff using bash and Node.js scripts. I prowl the web to discover typography and vector art, and find shiny new tools to tinker with (I've signed up for way more beta programs than anyone should). I also dedicate a fair chunk of my time for reading fiction, history, and physics.

Feel free to look around and contact me with any questions at [@Microflash](https://www.twitter.com/Microflash) (which is the namesake of this site).

### About this site

This site started out as a pet project for me while learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It helped me to get my bearing around Vue.js community, accessible color systems, content preloading, optimization of vector illustrations, [unifiedjs](https://unifiedjs.com/) ecosystem, and more.

Currently, I'm posting my notes and opinions on the development and design collected over the years, mostly to share what I learn and receive ~~criticism and scorn~~ constructive feedback. The code described in the examples is meant for the demonstration of the topic under discussion; it is not meant to be copy-pasted as-is in production.
