[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is an opinionated code formatter that formats the code in a consistent style. It supports popular languages, libraries, and frameworks in the Node.js ecosystem and is widely used to enforce the style practices. 

In this post, we'll integrate it with a Node.js application and explore on how to configure it to work with EditorConfig and ESLint. 

:::note Setup
You can pick the Node.js application created in the post [Using Express with TypeScript](/blog/2019/01/12/using-express-with-typescript/) to start with.
:::

## Install Prettier

Execute the following command in the directory where `package.json` is located:

```sh
yarn add -D -E prettier
```

As per the Prettier's [documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html), it is recommended to save an exact version of prettier in the `package.json` since it introduces stylistic changes in patch releases.

### Configure pre-commit hook

To format the staged files before you commit them to git, you can use `pretty-quick` to run prettier on staged files and `husky` to configure a pre-commit hook.

Execute the following command to install dependencies.

```sh
yarn add -D pretty-quick husky
```

Add an `fmt` script in `package.json` to format the staged files and configure the `husky` object with a hook.

```json{3, 7}
{
  "scripts": {
    "fmt": "pretty-quick --staged"
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm run fmt"
    }
  }
}
```

## Working with EditorConfig

EditorConfig is a popular way to maintain consistent coding styles between multiple developers across different editors and IDEs. It consists of a `.editorconfig` file that contains coding styles and a plugin that enables the editors and IDEs to enforce those styles.

An `editorconfig` file for an Angular application generated by Angular CLI looks like this:

```ini
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[*.md]
max_line_length = off
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

Prettier CLI respects the `editorconfig` file by default. You can opt-out of this behavior using `--no-editorconfig` flag.

## Working with ESLint

If you're working on a JavaScript project, you can use ESLint to format your code with Prettier. Execute the following command to add necessary plugins.

```sh
yarn add -D eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
```

Now, open the `.eslintrc.json` file and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:prettier/recommended"
  ]
}
```
