## Contributing

Since this is my personal site, I'm not really looking for feature requests. I'd, however, appreciate bug reports and corrections. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/naiyerasif/naiyerasif.com/issues/new) on accessibility, browser rendering inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and general usability criticism.
